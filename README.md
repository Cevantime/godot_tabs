Godot Tabs
==========

What is this ?
---------------

Godot Tabs is a very simple plugin that allows you to organize your scenes into tabs inside the editor.
Its purpose is to overcome the slowness of the workflow when using the file system directly.
Basically, you create shortcuts to your scenes which you classify into tabs using a simple drag and drop from the file system (a bit like Unity prefabs)
You can then very quickly access your scenes and incorporate them into other scenes.

How does it work ?
-------------------

Just download or clone it. Activate it like any Godot plugin (Project -> Project Settings -> Plugins) and you will see a "My tabs" tab appear in the bottom panel:

You can then create as many tabs as you wish and fill them with your scene shortcuts.

Then you will be able de access your scenes and incorporate them in other scenes using a simple drag and drop.
